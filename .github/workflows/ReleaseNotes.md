## What's Changed?

* Sound data has been added.
  * Moves can have multiple sound effects that play as the move plays.
  * Each attack has their own sound effect for when the move lands.
  * Footstep sounds for walking and running can be set and which frames they play on for the animation can be set.
  * These sounds can be played directly within the character editor.
* UI updates; the buttons in the sprite viewer have been adjusted to make them more intuitive.
* Fixed a bug where the editor crashes when creating a new character.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
