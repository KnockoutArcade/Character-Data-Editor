## What's Changed?

* Added new sprite data for Rush Cancels and Wall Splats.
* Added more data for supplementary move scripts. Now you can toggle whether you want to use them or not.
* Added supplementary scripts for hits and projectiles.
* Removed time stop duration for hits.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
* The sprite animation for projectiles with Has Lifetime set to false doesn't animate at the correct speed.
