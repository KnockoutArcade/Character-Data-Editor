## What's Changed?

* Added two new pieces of Spirit data.
  * Added a toggle for whether a move should switch to Spirit ON if it summons the spirit in Spirit OFF.
  * Add a toggle for if double jump should be enabled in Spirit ON.
* Fixed a bug that added unnecessary information in the json files.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
