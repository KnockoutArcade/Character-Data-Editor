## What's Changed?

* Added super data.
  * There are two types of supers: attack supers and install supers.
    * Attack supers can have a final hit setting where only the final hit will KO the opponent.
    * Install supers can alter different stats for a set amount of time.
* Block stun now has to be whole numbers.
* Fixed a bug with projectiles always saving even if you don't edit them.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
* The sprite animation for projectiles with Has Lifetime set to false doesn't animate at the correct speed.
