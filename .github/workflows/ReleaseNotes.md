## What's Changed?

* Added projectile data.
  * Projectiles have different data from regular characters.
  * Projectiles can copy a character's palette to have different colors for each palette or it can just have one color across all palettes.
  * Projectiles have window data for if they have a lifetime, giving them some extra flexibility with hitbox data.
* Added gravity scaling for attacks.
* Fixed some bugs and crashes.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
* The sprite animation for projectiles with Has Lifetime set to false doesn't animate at the correct speed.
