## What's Changed?

* Fixed a crash where creating window data crashed the editor.
* Removed cancel list for spirits. They have to be set in the host character.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
