## What's Changed?

* Added Unique Data for specific character gimmicks.
  * Characters can now have additional movesets, and each move can change which moveset the player is currently using.
  * Data has been created for Spirits (for Jay specifically), but nothing is implemented for it yet.
* Special moves and enhancements now have an option for if the move should only be performed on the ground, in the air, or either.

## Known Bugs

* None!
