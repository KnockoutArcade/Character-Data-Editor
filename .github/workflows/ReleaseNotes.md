## What's Changed?

* Added a boolean for spirits that determine if a move should be performed if the corresponding move in Spirit OFF is used to summon it.
* Added new data linking movesets with spirits if a character has multiple movesets and has a spirit.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
