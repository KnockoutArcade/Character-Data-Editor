## What's Changed?

* Spirit data has been added.
  * Characters can now have spirit, be a spirit, or neither.
    * If the character has a spirit, they have data to control their spirit.
    * If the character is a spirit, lots of data is added and omitted to help classify them as a spirit.
* Bug fixes with sprite and hitbox rendering.

## Known Bugs

* The sounds aren't perfect. Because of lag, the timing for when they play fluctuates. I'm not sure if this can be improved any further.
* The sounds for the footsteps are extra gnarly.
